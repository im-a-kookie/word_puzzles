# Word Puzzles

A simple Flutter Project that provides a few random word puzzles (currently: a version of Boggle, and NYTimes Spelling Bee).

Mostly just made this to learn a bit about Flutter/Dart, and this definitely isnt the right way to do a lot of what I've done (it's a bit messy, but hey, now I actually know how to make things less messy next time).

The only really notable aspect of this project is the grid creation and solution algorithm, though mostly it's pretty conventional TRIE and random walking to insert words into 4x4 grids.
